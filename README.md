 A Simple Facebook Pages Scrapper without using Facebook API

# How its work?

its so simple class, just include it:
require_once __DIR__.'/scrapper.php';

then call it like this:
$entries = $Scrapobj->scrappage($id);
//the $id is the facebook page/account you want to scrapp its contents

//more details: take a look on the example script : scrappage.php
